# <Planner>

## Description

This webpage is meant to be used for an hour planner for the current day, while also showing if it is past that time or if it is coming up.

In doing this I have learned that parseInt() can be used to help targeting classes by focusing on the number provided.

## Usage

To get the page to work you just need to click the save button after typing out what it is that you have planned, and it will load on refresh or reload as well! To get the page cleared, access your dev tools and clear the local storage.

## Credits

Juno Ngyuen- My tutor for the week, and hopefully moving forward helped with me being able to create the loops needed.

TAs and Instructor- Everyone involved in the class helped tremendously as well.
